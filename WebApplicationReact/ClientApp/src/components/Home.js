                                <p>Becket &amp; Lee has serviced bankrupt accounts since 1984, with an emphasis on consumer debt. Unlike other law firms and collection agencies, all of our resources, processes and staff are focused on maximizing our clients' bankruptcy recoveries. We do not purchase our clients' accounts, thus avoiding any possible conflict of interest. Our goal is to provide service and advice to each of our clients as if we were an in-house bankruptcy department.</p>
